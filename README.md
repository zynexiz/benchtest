# benchtest
This script is for for benchmarking cryptoographic ciphers in a live environment on a prepartitioned drive. Unlike cryptsetup benchmark, that only runes in memory, this tests the actual read and write speed on a device. This code was created for a paper i worked on in 2022 for a project on Halmstad University, Sweden.
